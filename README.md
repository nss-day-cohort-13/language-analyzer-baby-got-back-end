  #### Information

The team was instructed to build a language analyzer while meeting 2 requirements...

- A full test suite: There should be no logic for which there is not a test.
- Documentation: Every class and every method should have a docstring.

The Language Analyzer itself should analyze test statements and output a report of its analysis of Sentiment, Behavior and Domain in a numerical range between 0 and 1.

#### Here is the basic functionality for each Module:
**Tokenizer** contains methods that are called as needed to parse the original message.

**Behavior Predictor** determines what behaviors are present in the message, prints a report and pass those behaviors in a list to the Sentiemetn Module.

**Sentiment Analysis** shows what percentage positive, negative or neutral the statement is. The inherited behaviors have a slight factor on the overall sentiment.

**Domain Identifier** determines the subject matter of the message.
